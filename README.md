# heart-disease-classifier
binary classification for the presence of heart disease 
performed data explotoray analysis and data visualization using pandas and seaborn, model training using logistic regrission, decision tree, and random forest,
hyperparameter tuning using grid search 

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
age: age in years<br>
sex: sex<br>
1 = male<br>
0 = female<br>
cp: chest pain type<br>
Value 0: typical angina<br>
Value 1: atypical angina<br>
Value 2: non-anginal pain<br>
Value 3: asymptomatic<br>
trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)<br>
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl<br>
fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)<br>
1 = true;<br>
0 = false<br>
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results<br>
Value 0: normal<br>
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)<br>
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria<br>
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved<br>
exang: exercise induced angina<br>
1 = yes<br>
0 = no<br>
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest<br>
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment<br>
Value 0: upsloping<br>
Value 1: flat<br>
Value 2: downsloping<br>
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy<br>
thal:<br>
0 = error (in the original dataset 0 maps to NaN's)<br>
1 = fixed defect<br>
2 = normal<br>
3 = reversable defect<br>
target <br>
0 = no disease,<br>
1 = disease<br>
